## If Statement

1.  🎖Make a simple calculator with these functions. Using prompt, type conversion, if else statement. Use prompt to take the input from user i.e two numbers and an operation (Add, Sub, Mul, Div).

⛑ Rule
_ [ ] While substracting and dividing keep in mind the number one should be greater then number two. If not show alert saying `Number Two is larger then Number one`.
⚡️ Operations
_ [ ] Add
_ [ ] Sub
_ [ ] Mul \* [ ] Div
```js
//code

```

2. 🎖Write a if else statement which checks if the status is single `console.log` the message `John is single` or else `John is married`

```js
var firstName = "John";
var status = "single";
// Your code goes here
if (status == "single") console.log("John is single");
else console.log("John is married");
```

3. 🎖Write a JavaScript program that takes two `integers` from user (using prompt) and alerts the larger number.

```js
// your code goes here
var a = prompt("enter 1st integer");
var b = prompt("enter 2nd integer");
if (a > b) alert("a is greater");
else alert("b is greater");
```

4. 🎖Write a JavaScript conditional statement to find the sign (+, -) of product of three numbers. Take those three numbers from user using `prompt`. Display an alert box with the specified sign.

```js
// Your code goes here
var a=prompt();
var b=prompt();
var c=prompt();
var pro=a*b*c;
if (pro>0)
console.log("+")
else
console.log("-")
```

## Switch Statement

1. 🎖Using switch statement do the following

Take a number value from user and alert the message if it matches the conditions.

- [ ] ONE, if `number` is equal to 1.
- [ ] TWO, if `number` is equal to 2.
- [ ] THREE, if `number` is equal to 3.
- [ ] FOUR, if `number` is equal to 4.
- [ ] FIVE, if `number` is equal to 5.
- [ ] SIX, if `number` is equal to 6.
- [ ] SEVEN, if `number` is equal to 7.
- [ ] EIGHT, if `number` is equal to 8.
- [ ] NINE, if `number` is equal to 9.
- [ ] PLEASE TRY AGAIN, if is none of the above.

```js
// Your code goes here
```

2. 🎖Using switch statement do the following

Take the value of `marks` (0-100) from user using `prompt` and `alert` the message (Your Grade is AA) as giver below.

- [ ] `AA` if `marks` is greater than 90.
- [ ] `AB` if `marks` is greater than 80 and less than or equal to 90
- [ ] `BB` if `marks` is greater than 70 and less than or equal to 80
- [ ] `BC` if `marks` is greater than 60 and less than or equal to 70
- [ ] `CC` if `marks` is greater than 50 and less than or equal to 60
- [ ] `CD` if `marks` is greater than 40 and less than or equal to 50
- [ ] `DD` if `marks` is greater than 30 and less than or equal to 40
- [ ] `FF` if `marks` is less than or equal to 30

```js
// Your code goes here
```
