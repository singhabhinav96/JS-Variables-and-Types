```js
var name = "Mark"; //name is a variable
```

2. Find the error if any

```js
  var product cost = 3.45;//variable declaration should not have spaces.
```

3. Write `Right or Wrong` next to the code below.

```js
  "Hello World"//right
  'Hello World"
  "Hello World'
  'Hello World'
```

## Write `VALID` and `INVALID` infront of the variable name defined below

```js
var man;//valid
var 1girl;//invalid
var woman3;//valid
var -girl;//invalid
var blackDog;//valid
var 42;//invalid
var $42;//invalid
var userName;//valid
var x, y, z;//valid
var x = 5, y = 6, z = 7;//valid
var x = 5 + 10 + 2;//valid
```

## Basic Operations

Mathematical Operations:

Solve this using mathematical operations. (+, -, \*, / , etc)

```js
var amount = 2080;
// Define a new variable and store the value that is 80 less then the value of amount.
var n_amount=amount-80;

// Define a new variable and store the value that is 200 more then the value of amount.
var ne_amount=amount +200;

// Define a new variable and store the value that is 4 times the value of amount.
var new_variable = amount*4;

// Define a new variable and store the reminder when the value of amount is  divided by 21.
var new = amount%21;
```

Logical Operation:

Solve this using logical operations. (<, >, &&, ||)

```js
var johnAge = 45;
var markAge = 35;

// Check who is older eithe John or Mark
johnAge > markAge;
// Check who is younger
markAge < johnAge;
// Check if their age is equal
johnAge == markAge;
// Create a new variable and assign the age of john to new variable.
var newJohnAge = 45;
// Check if john is equal to or greater then mark.
johnAge >= markAge;
// Check if john is less then or equal to mark.
johnAge <= markAge;

// Calculate the average age of john and mark and assign to a new variable.
var avgAge = johnAge + markAge;
```
